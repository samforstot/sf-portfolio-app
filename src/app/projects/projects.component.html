                <p>Mealdealz is a webapp that streamlines cooking and grocery shopping in the attempt to make the lives of college students (or anyone) easier! For this project, I collaborated with a team using an agile workflow and HTML, CSS, and Typescript within the Angular Frameowork. I also wrote Python scripts that run within a VM periodically to scrape weekly deals from various grocery stores. </p>

                <p>The Gator Path Tracker (GPT) is an in-development project makes use of a web driver within various Python scripts to grab student-produced opinions and data relating to the overall difficulty of classes at the Univeristy of Florida. Sources include sites ranging from Reddit (r/ufl) to RateMyProfessor. This data is then passed to OpenAI's ChatGPT API to perform language processing to rate each class and further build a schedule for users.</p>

                <p>The Direct Replay Information Gatherer is an application that displays information based on around 300,000 individual statlines from the National Basketball Association from 2019-2022. This project is meant to test the varying time differences when executing quick sort and merge sort algorithms. Using C++, Windows Forms .NET Framework, and Adobe Photoshop, a UI was created to display results of user searches.<p>

                <p>Hardwood Hustle is a side project I did one night so that I could occupy myslef during <i>boring</i> times of the day. This console game makes use of multiple data sets and C++ to run users through a simulated college basketball season with chances of going to March Madness! Other features include recruiting a team and status checking on your overall win statistics! </p>
